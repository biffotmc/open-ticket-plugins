# Open Ticket Plugins

This is a small collection of plugins for the [open-ticket](https://github.com/DJj123dj/open-ticket) discord bot that I have developed.

I have alot of private plugins that I am currently not releasing because they are either badly written, already being added to open-ticket or they were made for private use.
